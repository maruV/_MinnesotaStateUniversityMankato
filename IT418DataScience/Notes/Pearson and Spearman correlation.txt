Response variable is when you are predicting something. Also called as dependent variable; ex: what grade you will get in the test
Explanatory variable is dependent variable. ex: Exam scores, Attendance, etc.

Pearson's R uses Quantitative variables: Response and Explanatory.
Do not use Pearson's R unless you have the scatterplot.
Use Pearson's R only for Linear corelation not curvilinear or anything else.

Use Spearman correlation for non-linear correlations.
